](https://ai-trip-planner-pro-clzjkmhnrkzo5jtldh8ehj.streamlit.app/))

An advanced, AI-powered web application that creates dynamic, personalized, and interactive travel itineraries. Built for the Google Gen AI Exchange Hackathon.



## ‚ú® About The Project

My solution, the AI Trip Planner Pro, is a sophisticated web application I built that leverages Generative AI to create dynamic, personalized travel itineraries.

It goes beyond simple text generation by prompting the AI to return a rich, structured dataset, including GPS coordinates and cost estimates for each activity. I then use this data to power a modern, interactive dashboard with several key features.

## üéØ Key Features

* **Hyper-Personalization:** Creates a truly unique itinerary from scratch based on a user's specific destination, dates, budget, travel pace, and interests.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A professional, multi-tab dashboard with a sidebar for inputs, keeping the results clean and easy to navigate.
* **Vertical Itinerary Timeline:** Displays the day-by-day plan in a visually engaging and modern timeline format.
* **Automated Budget Analysis:** A dedicated tab provides a bar chart of estimated daily expenses and a metric for the total trip cost.
